### **Overview of the StudentGradesManager Project**

The **StudentGradesManager** project is a Java-based application designed to manage and track student grades for various subjects. It provides an interactive interface for users to add grades, calculate averages, and display detailed grade summaries. The project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming, collections, and basic input handling in Java.

---

### **Purpose**
The project aims to simplify the process of recording and managing student grades while offering insights like average grade calculation and letter-grade assignment. It is suitable for educational purposes or as a base for building more advanced student management systems.

---

### **Key Features**
1. **Grade Management**:
   - Users can add grades for specific subjects.
   - Grades are stored in a dynamic list using the `ArrayList` class.

2. **Average Calculation**:
   - The program computes the average of all entered grades.
   - If no grades are recorded, the average is displayed as `0.0`.

3. **Letter Grade Conversion**:
   - Converts numerical averages into letter grades based on a predefined scale:
     - A: 90–100
     - B: 80–89
     - C: 70–79
     - D: 60–69
     - F: Below 60

4. **Grade Display**:
   - Lists all recorded grades alongside their subjects.
   - Shows the overall average grade and corresponding letter grade.

5. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Menu-driven interaction with options to add grades, display grades, or exit the program.

### **Technical Highlights**
1. **Object-Oriented Design**:
   - Uses a nested `Subject` class to encapsulate subject names and grades.
2. **Dynamic Storage**:
   - Utilizes `ArrayList` to manage a flexible number of grades.
3. **Input Handling**:
   - Validates user input to ensure smooth program execution.
4. **Control Flow**:
   - A `while` loop and `switch` statement manage user actions.

---

### **Practical Use**
The project is ideal for beginners learning Java, as it covers:
- Core OOP principles.
- Collections (`ArrayList`).
- Input validation and exception handling.
  
It can be extended to include advanced features like data persistence, student-specific reports, or GPA calculations.
